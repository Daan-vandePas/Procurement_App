**Primary User**:
- Engineers and magaziniers requesting items
- Purchaser placing orders
- CEO approving requests

**Goal**:
Submit, process, approve, and order requested materials/tools in under 48 hours from submission.

**Context**:
All users access the platform from laptops, in-office or remotely, via online portal with MS Office login.

**Frustrations**:
1. Current process is very slow.
2. No centralized request tracking (only purchaser knows status via physical forms).
3. Delays when CEO is out of office.

**Technical Comfort**:
Medium.

**Time Constraints**:
- Request creation or approval must take â‰¤60 seconds.

**Special Considerations**:
- Future permission flexibility: option to grant purchaser the ability to order without approval.
- Multiple items can be requested in one submission.
- CEO must check platform daily for approvals.
