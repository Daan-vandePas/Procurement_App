## Success Definition

**Target Level**: MVP  
The system must be fully usable by our team for real procurement requests. Visual polish is secondary to functionality and accuracy.

**Core Success Criteria**:
1. Requester can submit a request in ≤60 seconds.  
2. CEO can approve a request in ≤60 seconds.  
3. Purchaser can link prices (by entering amounts or uploading PDF/image) to each requested item easily before CEO approval.  
4. From request submission to purchaser placing the order takes ≤48 hours in at least 90% of cases.  
5. System experiences no more than 1 failed request per 100 in the first month.  
6. Team rates overall usefulness ≥8/10 in feedback survey after first month of use.

**Validation Method**:
- Live beta test with all 10–15 intended users integrated into actual workflow.  
- Monitor time taken for each role’s main action.  
- Track % of requests completed within 48h.  
- Record failure rates.  
- Collect feedback survey after 4 weeks of use.

**Timeline**:
- MVP functional within 2 days of coding (8h/day work schedule).
