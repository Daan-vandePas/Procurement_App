# Project Vision

## Problem
Our engineering and production teams currently request materials and tools via a physical paper form.  
The process is slow, requires physical presence, and is prone to delays or lost information.

The physical form includes:
- Requester name
- Reason (e.g., spare parts)
- Item details (quantity, description, supplier reference, link if available)
- Consulted supplier
- Priority (urgent, medium, low)
- Requester signature

Once submitted, the purchaser manually searches online for components, prints price info, staples it to the form, and passes it to the CEO for approval.  
Only after CEO approval can the purchaser place the order.

## Target User
- Engineers and magaziniers submitting requests
- Purchaser processing and ordering items
- CEO as the sole approver

## Success Metric
1. Reduce request-to-purchase-order time to ≤48 hours (from submission to purchaser ordering).  
2. Free purchaser’s time by 3–4 hours per week by eliminating manual paperwork.

## Why Software?
- Ensures all users can submit, approve, and track requests remotely.
- Eliminates dependency on physical paper handling.
- Creates transparent request tracking for all roles.

## Requirements & Constraints
- CEO approval mandatory for all orders.
- Purchaser orders items only after CEO approval.
- Description + quantity fields mandatory; supplier link/reference optional.
- Multiple items can be added in one request.
- MS Office account login for authentication.
- Dedicated portal views for requester, purchaser, and CEO.
- Only digital requests are approved; paper forms are not accepted.
